## Issues

- **Video Length Limitation**: Currently, the application can only process video files of length up to **1 minute** or less.
  
- **Audio Quality with Music**: The audio replacement does not work very well with audio tracks that have **both music and voice** together. It performs better with audio tracks that have clear voice without background music.
